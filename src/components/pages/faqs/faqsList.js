    {
        question: "What differentiates us from other business fraternities?",
        answer: "Lambda Phi Nu is devoted to serving our community and we have an unparalleled presence on campus. We’ve founded nine of Merage’s business organizations, and every one of our Brothers has achieved Leadership positions in different campus organizations since. Additionally, we have direct relationships with all our Alumni, including our founders! As the only business fraternity founded at UC Irvine, our network is extremely tight knit and we foster relationships with all of our alumni. Each year alumni from all classes, even our founders, come back for fraternity events, to bond with their families, or just to have casual hang outs. This gives our Active Brothers the opportunity to receive first-hand mentorship to help them thrive in the professional world.",
    },
    {
        question: "What is Rush?",
        answer: "Our rushing process consists of four events where interested candidates get to meet our Active Brothers, Alumni, and fellow Rushees to help them decide if Lambda Phi Nu is an organization they want to join. It culminates in one invite-only event and a series of interviews with our Brothers. If everything goes well, candidates receive bids to begin the Pledging process!",
    },
    {
        question: "Can non-business majors join?",
        answer: "Yes! We value diverse perspectives from all kinds of backgrounds. Even though the majority of our brothers are majoring in Business Administration, some of our Active Brothers are pursuing degrees in Computer Science and Economics. Furthermore, our Brothers work in fields from all sorts of disciplines, including Consulting, UI/UX Design, Project Management, and more! As long as you are interested in learning more about the world of business, we encourage you to rush.",
    },
    {
        question: "What are the requirements to join Lambda Phi Nu?",
        answer: "Applicants must be current undergraduate students with at least 2 quarters left to complete at UCI. Additionally, you must have a cumulative GPA of at least 3.0.",
    },
    {
        question: "What qualities do you look for in a candidate?",
        answer: "We look for students with a variety of skills, personalities, and backgrounds! Some common themes include: a genuine growth mindset, a desire to help those in need, and an aptitude for leadership. We accept students in all stages of their personal and professional development, and we encourage you to attend our rush events to learn more about what we value in candidates.",
    },
    {
        question: "What is a bid?",
        answer: "After successfully completing the recruitment and interview process, a bid may be extended to a candidate. A bid is an invitation to participate in the pledge program in order to eventually join the fraternity as an Active Partner.",
    },
    {
        question: "If I don't get a bid, can I recruit again?",
        answer: "Yes! If you feel that Lambda Phi Nu is the place for you, we encourage you to rush again. That being said, Lambda Phi Nu is not the only professional fraternity at UCI. We encourage you to look at other organizations if you feel you mesh better with their culture.",
    },
    {
        question: "What is pledging?",
        answer: "After accepting a bid, a candidate becomes an Associate and partakes in a 7-week long process to join the fraternity. The time commitment is comparable to a four-unit class or a part-time internship. Led by our Alumni and Active Brothers, our curriculum is designed to emulate the professional world. Associates will gain professional and personal skills through a series of workshops, projects, and presentations all while building meaningful relationships. At the end of the 7 weeks, Associates are considered to join the brotherhood as an Active Partner.",
